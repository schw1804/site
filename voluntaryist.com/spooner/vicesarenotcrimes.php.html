<h2>Vices Are Not Crimes: A Vindication of Moral Liberty
</h2>

<br><h5>by LYSANDER SPOONER [1875]</h5>
[From Part Second of Dio Lewis' book, PROHIBITION: A FAILURE (1875). Identified by Benjamin Tucker and found by Carl Watner.]

</center>


<p>

<p align="left">Vices
are those acts by which a man harms himself or his property. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Crimes
are those acts by which one man harms the person or property of
another. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Vices
are simply the errors which a man makes in his search after his
own happiness. Unlike crimes, they imply no malice toward others,
and no interference with their persons or property. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> In
vices, the very essence of crime - that is, the design to injure
the person or property of another - is wanting. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> It
is a maxim of the law that there can be no crime without a
criminal intent; that is, without the intent to invade the person
or property of another. But no one ever practises a vice with any
such criminal intent. He practices his vice for his own happiness
solely, and not from any malice toward others. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Unless
this clear distinction between vices and crimes be made and
recognized by the laws, there can be on earth no such thing as
individual right, liberty, or property, and the corresponding and
coequal rights of another man to the control of his own person
and property. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> For
a government to declare a vice to be a crime, and to punish it as
such, is an attempt to falsify the very nature of things. It is
as absurd as it would be to declare truth to be falsehood, or
falsehood truth. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left">  II.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> Every
voluntary act of a man's life is either virtuous or vicious. That
is to say, it is either in accordance, or in conflict, with those
natural laws of matter and mind, on which his physical, mental,
and emotional health and well-being depend. In other words, every
act of his life tends, on the whole, either to his happiness, or
to his unhappiness. No single act in his whole existence is
indifferent. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Furthermore,
each human being differs in his physical, mental, and emotional
constitution, and also in the circumstances by which he is
surrounded, from every other human being. Many acts, therefore,
that are virtuous, and tend to happiness, in the case of one
person, are vicious, and tend to unhappiness, in the case of
another person. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  Many
acts, also, that are virtuous, and tend to happiness, in the case
of one man, at one time, and under one set of circumstances, are
vicious, and tend to unhappiness, in the case of the same man, at
another time, and under other circumstances. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> III.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left">To
know what actions are virtuous, and what vicious - in other
words, to know what actions tend, on the whole, to happiness, and
what to unhappiness - in the case of each and every man, in each
and all the conditions in which they may severally be placed, is
the profoundest and most complex study to which the greatest
human mind ever has been, or ever can be, directed. It is,
nevertheless, the constant study to which each and every man -
the humblest in intellect as well as the greatest - is
necessarily driven by the desires and necessities of his own
existence. It is also the study in which each and every person,
from his cradle to his grave, must necessarily form his own
conclusions; because no one else knows or feels, or can know or
feel, as he knows and feels, the desires and necessities, the
hopes, and fears, and impulses of his own nature, or the pressure
of his own circumstances. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> IV.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left">  It
is not often possible to say of those acts that are called vices,
that they really are vices, except in degree. That is, it is
difficult to say of any actions, or courses of action, that are
called vices, that they really would have been vices, if they had
stopped short of a certain point. The question of virtue or vice,
therefore, in all such cases, is a question of quantity and
degree, and not of the intrinsic character of any single act, by
itself. This fact adds to the difficulty, not to say the
impossibility, of any one's - except each individual for himself
- drawing any accurate line, or anything like any accurate line,
between virtue and vice; that is, of telling where virtue ends,
and vice begins. And this is another reason why this whole
question of virtue and vice should be left for each person to
settle for himself. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> V.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> Vices
are usually pleasurable, at least for the time being, and often
do not disclose themselves as vices, by their effects, until
after they have been practised for many years; perhaps for a
lifetime. To many, perhaps most, of those who practise them, they
do not desclose themselves as vices at all during life. Virtues,
on the other hand, often appear so harsh and rugged, they require
the sacrifice of so much present happiness, at least, and the
results, which alone prove them to be virtues, are often so
distant and obscure, in fact, so absolutely invisible to the
minds of many, especially of the young that, from the very nature
of things, there can be no universal, or even general, knowledge
that they are virtues. In truth, the studies of profound
philosophers have been expended - if not wholly in vain,
certainly with very small results - in efforts to draw the lines
between the virtues and the vices. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> If,
then, it became so difficult, so nearly impossible, in most
cases, to determine what is, and what is not, vice; and
especially if it be so difficult, in nearly all cases, to
determine where virtue ends, and vice begins; and if these
questions, which no one can really and truly determine for
anybody but himself, are not to be left free and open fro
experiment by all, each person is deprived of the highest of all
his rights as a human being, to wit: his right to inquire,
investigate, reason, try experiments, judge, and ascertain for
himself, what is, to him, virtue, and what is, to him, vice; in
other words: what, on the whole, conduces to his happiness, and
what, on the whole, tends to his unhappiness. If this great right
is not to be left free and open to all, then each man's whole
right, as a reasoning human being, to &quot;liberty and the
pursuit of happiness,&quot; is denied him. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left">  </font></h3>

<p align="left"> We
all come into the world in ignorance of ourselves, and of
everything around us. By a fundamental law of our natures we are
all constantly impelled by the desire of happiness, and the fear
of pain. But we have everything to learn, as to what will give us
happiness, and save us from pain. No two of us are wholly alike,
either physically, mentally, or emotionally; or, consequently, in
our physical, mental, or emotional requirements for the
acquisition of happiness, and the avoidance of unhappiness. No
one of us, therefore can learn this indispensable lesson of
happiness and unhappiness, of virtue and vice, for another. Each
must learn it for himself. To learn it, he must be at liberty to
try all experiments that comment themselves to his judgement.
Some of his experiments succeed, and, because they succeed, are
called virtues; others fail, and, because they fail, are called
vices. He gathers wisdom as much from his failures as from his
successes; from his so-called vices, as from his so-called
virtues. Both are necessary to his acquisition of that knowledge
- of his own nature, and of the world around him, and of their
adaptations or non-adaptations to each other - which shall show
him how happiness is acquired, and pain avoided. And, unless he
can be permitted to try these experiments to his own
satisfaction, he is restrained from the acquisition of knowledge,
and, consequently, from pursuing the great purpose and duty of
his life. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> VII.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> A
man is under no obligation to take anybody's word, or yield to
anybody's authority, on a matter so vital to himself, and in
regard to which no one else has, or can have, any such interest
as he. He cannot, if he would, safely rely upon the opinions of
other men, because he finds that the opinions of other men do not
agree. Certain actions, or courses of action, have been practised
by many millions of men, through successive generations, and have
been held by them to be, on the whole, conducive to happiness,
and therefore virtuous. Other men, in other ages or counties, or
under other conditions, have held, as the result of their
experience and observation, that these actions tended, on the
whole, to unhappiness, and were therefore vicious. The question
of virtue or vice, as already remarked in a previous section, has
also been, in most minds, a question of degree; that is, of the
extent to which certain actions should be carried; and not of the
intrinsic character of any single act, by itself. The questions
of virtue and vice have therefore been as various, and, in fact,
as infinite, as the varieties of mind body, and condition of the
different individuals inhabiting the globe. And the experience of
ages has left an infinite number of these questions unsettled. In
fact, it can scarcely be said to have settled any of them. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> VIII.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left">   In
the midst of this endless variety of opinion, what man, or what
body of men, has the right to say, in regard to any particular
action, or course of action, &quot;we have tried this experiment,
and determined every question involved in it? We have determined
it, not only for ourselves, but for all others? And, as to all
those who are weaker than we, we will coerce them to act in
obedience to our conclusions? We will suffer no further
experiment or inquiry by any one, and, consequently, no further
acquisition of knowledge by anybody?&quot; </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  Who
are the men who have the right to say this? Certainly there are
none such. The men who really do say it are either shameless
impostors and tyrants, who would stop the progress of knowledge,
and usurp absolute control over the minds and bodies of their
fellow men; and are therefore to be resisted instantly, and to
the last extent; or they are themselves too ignorant of their own
weaknesses, and of their true relations to other men, to be
entitled to any other consideration then sheer pity or contempt. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> We
know, however, that there are such men as these in the world.
Some of them attempt to exercise their power only within a small
sphere, to wit, upon their children, their neighbors, their
townsmen, and their countrymen. Others attempt to exercise it on
a larger scale. For example, an old man at Rome, aided by a few
subordinates, attempts to decide all questions of virtue and
vice; that is, of truth or falsehood, especially in matters of
religion. He claims to know and teach what religious ideas and
practices are conducive, or fatal, to a man's happiness, not only
in this world, but in that which is to come. He claims to be
miraculously inspired for the performance of this work; thus
virtually acknowledging, like a sensible man, that nothing short
of miraculous inspiration would qualify him for it. This
miraculous inspiration, however, has been ineffectual to enable
him to settle more than a very few questions. The most important
to which common mortals can attain, is an implicit belief in his
(the pope's) infallibility! and, secondly, that the blackest
vices of which they can be guilty are to believe and declare that
he is only a man like the rest of them! </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> It
required some fifteen or eighteen hundred years to enable him to
reach definite conclusions on these two vital points. Yet it
would seem that the first of these must necessarily be
preliminary to his settlement of any other questions; because,
until his own infallibility is determined, he can authoritatively
decide nothing else. He has, however, heretofore attempted or
pretended to settle a few others. And he may, perhaps, attempt or
pretend to settle a few more in the future, if he shall continue
to find anybody to listen to him. But his success, thus far,
certainly does not encourage the belief that he will be able to
settle all questions of virtue and vice, even in his peculiar
department of religion, in time to meet the necessities of
mankind. He, or his successors, will undoubtedly be compelled, at
no distant day, to acknowledge that he has undertaken a task to
which all his miraculous inspiration was inadequate; and that, of
necessity, each human being must be left to settle all questions
of this kind for himself. And it is not unreasonable to expect
that all other popes, in other and lesser spheres, will some time
have cause to come to the same conclusion. No one, certainly, not
claiming supernatural inspiration, should undertake a task to
which obviously nothing less than such inspiration is adequate.
And, clearly, no one should surrender his own judgement to the
teachings of others, unless he be first convinced that these
others have something more than ordinary human knowledge on this
subject. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> If
those persons, who fancy themselves gifted with both the power
and the right to define and punish other men's vices, would but
turn their thoughts inwardly, they would probably find that they
have a great work to do at home; and that, when that shall have
been completed, they will be little disposed to do more towards
correcting the vices of others, than simply to give to others the
results of their experience and observation. In this sphere their
labors may possibly be useful; but, in the sphere of
infallibility and coercion, they will probably, for well-known
reasons, meet with even less success in the future than such men
have met with in the past. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> IX.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> It
is now obvious, from the reasons already given, that government
would be utterly impracticable, if it were to take cognizance of
vices, and punish them as crimes. Every human being has his or
her vices. Nearly all men have a great many. And they are of all
kinds; physiological, mental, emotional; religious, social,
commercial, industrial, economical, etc., etc. If government is
to take cognizance of any of these vices, and punish them as
crimes, then, to be consistent, it must take cognizance of all,
and punish all impartially. The consequence would be, that
everybody would be in prison for his of her vices. There would be
no one left outside to lock the doors upon those within. In fact,
courts enough could not be found to try the offenders, nor
prisons enough built to hold them. All human industry in the
acquisition of knowledge, and even in acquiring the means of
subsistence, would be arrested: for we should all be under
constant trial or imprisonment for our vices. But even if it were
possible to imprison all the vicious, our knowledge of human
nature tells us that, as a general rule, they would be far more
vicious in prison than they ever have been out of it. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> X.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> A
government that shall punish all vices impartially is so
obviously an impossibility, that nobody was ever found, or ever
will be found, foolish enough to propose it. The most that any
one proposes is, that government shall punish some one, or at
most a few, of what he esteems the grossest of them. But this
discrimination is an utterly absurd, illogical, and tyrannical
one. What right has any body of men to say, &quot;The vices of
other men we will punish; but our own vices nobody shall punish?
We will restrain other men from seeking their own happiness,
according to their own notions of it; but nobody shall restrain
us from seeking our own happiness, according to our own notions
of it? We will restrain other men from acquiring any experimental
knowledge of what is conducive or necessary to their own
happiness; but nobody shall restrain us from acquiring an
experimental knowledge of what is conducive or necessary to our
own happiness?&quot; </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Nobody
but knaves or blockheads ever thinks of making such absurd
assumptions as these. And yet, evidently, it is only upon such
assumptions that anybody can claim the right to punish the vices
of others, and at the same time claim exemption from punishment
for his own. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left">  XI.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> Such
a thing as a government, formed by voluntary association, would
never have been thought of, if the object proposed had been the
punishment of all vices, impartially; because nobody wants such
an institution, or would voluntarily submit to it. But a
government, formed by voluntary association, for the punishment
of all crimes, is a reasonable matter; because everybody wants
protection for himself against all crimes by others, and also
acknowledges the justice of his own punishment, if he commits a
crime. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> XII.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> It
is a natural impossibility that a government should have a right
to punish men for their vices; because it is impossible that a
government should have any rights, except such as the individuals
composing it had previously had, as individuals. They could not
delegate to a government any rights which they did not themselves
possess. They could not contribute to the government any rights,
except such as they themselves possessed as individuals. Now,
nobody but a fool or an impostor pretends that he, as an
individual, has a right to punish other men for their vices. But
anybody and everybody have a natural right, as individuals, to
punish other men for their crimes; for everybody has a natural
right not only to defend his own person and property against
aggressors, but also to go to the assistance and defence of
everybody else, whose person or property is invaded. The natural
right of each individual to defend his own person and property
against an aggressor, and to go to the assistance and defence of
every one else whose person or property is invaded, is a right
without which men could not exist on the earth. And government
has no rightful existence, except in so far as it embodies, and
is limited by, this natural right of individuals. But the idea
that each man has a natural right to decide what are virtues, and
what are vices - that is, what contributes to that neighbor's
happiness, and what do not - and to punish him for all that do
not contribute to his; is what no one ever had the impudence or
folly to assert. It is only those who claim that government has
some rightful power, which no individual or individuals ever did,
or ever could, delegate to it, that claim that government has any
rightful power to punish vices. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> It
will do for a pope or a king - who claims to have received direct
authority from Heaven, to rule over his fellowmen - to claim the
right, as the viceregent of God, to punish men for their vices;
but it is a sheer and utter absurdity for any government,
claiming to derive its power wholly from the grant of the
governed, to claim any such power; because everybody knows that
the governed never would grant it. For them to grant it would be
an absurdity, because it would be granting away their own right
to seek their own happiness; since to grant away their right to
judge of what will be for their happiness, is to grant away all
their right to pursue their own happiness. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> XIII.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> We
can now see how simple, easy, and reasonable a matter is a
government for the punishment of crimes, as compared with one for
the punishment of vices. Crimes are few, and easily distinguished
from all other acts; and mankind are generally agreed as to what
acts are crimes. Whereas vices are innumerable; and no two
persons are agreed, except in comparatively few cases, as to what
are vices. Furthermore, everybody wishes to be protected, in his
person and property, against the aggressions of other men. But
nobody wishes to be protected, either in his person or property,
against himself; because it is contrary to the fundamental laws
of human nature itself, that any one should wish to harm himself.
He only wishes to promote his own happiness, and to be his own
judge as to what will promote, and does promote, his own
happiness. This is what every one wants, and has a right to, as a
human being. And though we all make many mistakes, and
necessarily must make them, from the imperfection of our
knowledge, yet these mistakes are no argument against the right;
because they all tend to give us the very knowledge we need, and
are in pursuit of, and can get in no other way. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">   The
object aimed at in the punishment of crimes, therefore, is not
only wholly different from, but it is directly opposed to, that
aimed at in the punishment of vices. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> The
object aimed at in the punishment of crimes is to secure, to each
and every man alike, the fullest liberty he possibly can have -
consistently with the equal rights of others - to pursue his own
happiness, under the guidance of his own judgement, and by the
use of his own property. On the other hand, the object aimed at
in the punishment of vices, is to deprive every man of his
natural right and liberty to pursue his own happiness, under the
guidance of his own judgement, and by the use of his own
property. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> These
two objects, then, are directly opposed to each other. They are
as directly opposed to each other as are light and darkness, or
as truth and falsehood, or as liberty and slavery. They are
utterly incompatible with each other; and to suppose the two to
be embraced in one and the same government, is an absurdity, an
impossibility. It is to suppose the objects or a government to be
to commit crimes, and to prevent crimes; to destroy individual
liberty, and to secure individual liberty. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> XIV.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> Finally,
on this point of individual liberty: Every man must necessarily
judge and determine for himself as to what is conducive and
necessary to, and what is destructive of, his own well-being;
because, if he omits to perform this task for himself, nobody
else can perform it for him. And nobody else will even attempt to
perform it for him, except in very few cases. Popes, and priests,
and kings will assume to perform it for him, in certain cases, if
permitted to do so. But they will, in general, perform it only in
so far as they can minister to their own vices and crimes, by
doing it. They will, in general, perform it only in so far as
they can make him their fool and their slave. Parents, with
better motives, no doubt, than the others, too often attempt the
same work. But in so far as they practise coercion, or restrain a
child from anything not really and seriously dangerous to
himself, they do him a harm, rather than a good. It is a law of
Nature that to get knowledge, and to incorporate that knowledge
into his own being, each individual must get it for himself.
Nobody, not even his parents, can tell him the nature of fire, so
that he will really know it. He must himself experiment with it,
and be burnt by it, before he can know it. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Nature
knows, a thousand times better than any parent, what she designs
each individual for, what knowledge he requires, and how he must
get it. She knows that her own processes for communicating that
knowledge are not only the best, but the only ones that can be
effectual. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> The
attempts of parents to make their children virtuous are generally
little else than attempts to keep them in ignorance of vice. They
are little else than attempts to teach their children to know and
prefer truth, by keeping them in ignorance of falsehood. They are
little else than attempts to make them seek and appreciate
health, by keeping them in ignorance of disease, and of
everything that will cause disease. They are little else than
attempts to make their children love the light, by keeping them
in ignorance of darkness. In short, they are little else than
attempts to make their children happy, by keeping them in
ignorance of everything that causes them unhappiness. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> In
so far as parents can really aid their children in the latter's
search after happiness, by simply giving them the results of
their (the parents') own reason and experience, it is all very
well, and is a natural and appropriate duty. But to practise
coercion in matters of which the children are reasonably
competent to judge for themselves, is only an attempt to keep
them in ignorance. And this is as much a tyranny, and as much a
violation of the children's right to acquire knowledge for
themselves, and such knowledge as they desire, as is the same
coercion when practised upon older persons. Such coercion,
practised upon children, is a denial of their right to develop
the faculties that Nature has given them, and to be what Nature
designs them to be. It is a denial of their right to themselves,
and to the use of their own powers. It is a denial of their right
to acquire the most valuable of all knowledge, to wit, the
knowledge that Nature, the great teacher, stands ready to impart
to them. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> The
results of such coercion are not to make the children wise or
virtuous, but to make them ignorant, and consequently weak and
vicious; and to perpetuate through them, from age to age, the
ignorance, the superstitions, the vices, and the crimes of the
parents. This is proved by every page of the world's history. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Those
who hold opinions opposite to these, are those whose false and
vicious theologies, or whose own vicious general ideas, have
taught them that the human race are naturally given to evil,
rather than good; to the false, rather than the true; that
mankind do not naturally turn their eyes to the light; that they
love darkness, rather than light; and that they find their
happiness only in those things that tend to their misery. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> XV.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left">But
these men, who claim that government shall use its power to
prevent vice, will say, or are in the habit of saying, &quot;We
acknowledge the right of an individual to seek his own happiness
in his own way, and consequently to be as vicious as he pleases;
we only claim that government shall prohibit the sale to him of
those articles by which he ministers to his vice.&quot; </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> The
answer to this is, that the simple sale of any article whatever -
independently of the use that is to be made of the article - is
legally a perfectly innocent act. The quality of the act of sale
depends wholly upon the quality of the use for which the thing is
sold. If the use of anything is virtuous and lawful, then the
sale of it, for that use, is virtuous and lawful. If the use is
vicious, then the sale of it, for that use, is vicious. If the
use is criminal, then the sale of it, for that use, is criminal.
The seller is, at most, only an accomplice in the use that is to
be made os the article sold, whether the use be virtuous,
vicious, or criminal. Where the use is criminal, the seller is an
accomplice in the crime, and punishable as such. But where the
use is only vicious, the seller is only an accomplice in the
vice, and is not punishable. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> XVI.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> But
it will be asked, &quot;Is there no right, on the part of
government, to arrest the progress of those who are bent on
self-destruction?&quot; </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> The
answer is, that government has no rights whatever in the matter,
so long as these so-called vicious persons remain sane, compos
mentis, capable of exercising reasonable discretion and
self-control; because, so long as they do remain sane, they must
be allowed to judge and decide for themselves whether their
so-called vices really are vices; whether they really are leading
them to destruction; and whether, on the whole, they will go
there or not. When they shall become insane, non compos mentis,
incapable of reasonable discretion or self-control, their friends
or neighbors, or the government, must take care of them, and
protect them from harm, and against all persons who would do them
harm, in the same way as if their insanity had come upon them
from any other cause than their supposed vices. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> But
because a man is supposed, by his neighbors, to be on the way to
self-destruction, from his vices, it does not, therefore, follow
that he is insane, non compos mentis, incapable of reasonable
discretion and self-control, within the legal meaning of those
terms. Men and women may be addicted to very gross vices, and to
a great many of them - such as gluttony, drunkenness,
prostitution, gambling, prize-fighting, tobacco-chewing, smoking,
and snuffing, opium-eating, corset-wearing, idleness, waste of
property, avarice, hypocrisy, etc., etc. - and still be sane,
compos mentis, capable of reasonable discretion and self-control,
within the meaning of the law. And so long as they are sane, they
must be permitted to control themselves and their property, and
to be their own judges as to where their vices will finally lead
them. It may be hoped by the lookers-on, in each individual case,
that the vicious person will see the end to which he is tending,
and be induced to turn back. But, if he chooses to go on to what
other men call destruction, he must be permitted to do so. And
all that can be said of him, so far as this life is concerned,
is, that he made a great mistake in his search after happiness,
and that others will do well to take warning by his fate. As to
what may be his condition in another life, that is a theological
question with which the law, in this world, has no more to do
than it has with any other theological question, touching men's
condition in a future life. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> If
it be asked how the question of a vicious man's sanity or
insanity is to be determined? The answer is, that it is to be
determined by the same kinds of evidence as is the sanity or
insanity of those who are called virtuous; and not otherwise.
That is, by the same kinds of evidence by which the legal
tribunals determine whether a man should be sent to an asylum for
lunatics, or whether he is competent to make a will, or otherwise
dispose of his property. Any doubt must weigh in favor of his
sanity, as in all other cases, and not of his insanity. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> If
a person really does become insane, non compose mentis, incapable
of reasonable discretion or self-control, it is then a crime, on
the part of other men, to give to him or sell to him, the means
of self-injury.</kbd></font><a href="#note1"> 1</kbd></sup></font></a> There are no crimes
more easily punished, no cases in which juries would be more
ready to convict, than those where a sane person should sell or
give to an insane one any article with which the latter was
likely to injure himself. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> XVII.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> But
it will be said that some men are made, by their vices, dangerous
to other persons; that a drunkard, for example, is sometimes
quarrelsome and dangerous toward his family or others. And it
will be asked, &quot;has the law nothing to do in such a
case?&quot; </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> The
answer is, that if, either from drunkenness or any other cause, a
man be really dangerous, either to his family or to other
persons, not only himself may be rightfully restrained, so far as
the safety of other persons requires, but all other persons - who
know or have reasonable grounds to believe him dangerous - may
also be restrained from selling or giving to him anything that
they have reason to suppose will make him dangerous. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> But
because one man becomes quarrelsome and dangerous after drinking
spirituous liquors, and because it is a crime to give or sell
liquor to such a man, it does not follow at all that it is a
crime to sell liquors to the hundreds and thousands of other
persons, who are not made quarrelsome or dangerous by drinking
them. Before a man can be convicted of crime in selling liquor to
a dangerous man, it must be shown that the particular man, to
whom the liquor was sold, was dangerous; and also that the seller
knew, or had reasonable grounds to suppose, that the man would be
made dangerous by drinking it. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> The
presumption of law is, in all cases, that the sale is innocent;
and the burden of proving it criminal, in any particular case,
rests upon the government. And that particular case must be
proved criminal, independently of all others. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Subject
to these principles, there is no difficulty convicting and
punishing men for the sale or gift of any article to a man, who
is made dangerous to others by the use of it. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> XVIII.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> But
it is often said that some vices are nuisances (public or
private), and that nuisances can be abated and punished. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> It
is true that anything that is really and legally a nuisance
(either public or private) can be abated and punished. But it is
not true that the mere private vices of one man are, in any legal
sense, nuisances to another man, or to the public. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> No
act of one person can be a nuisance to another, unless it in some
way obstructs or interferes with that other's safe and quiet use
or enjoyment of what is rightfully his own. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Whatever
obstructs a public highway, is a nuisance, and may be abated and
punished. But a hotel where liquors are sold, a liquor store, or
even a grog-shop, so called, no more obstructs a public highway,
than does a dry goods store, a jewelry store, or a butcher's
shop. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Whatever
poisons the air, or makes it either offensive or unhealthy, is a
nuisance. But neither a hotel, nor a liquor store, nor a
grog-shop poisons the air, or makes it offensive or unhealthy to
outside persons. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Whatever
obstructs the light, to which a man is legally entitled, is a
nuisance. But neither a hotel, nor a liquor store, nor a
grog-shop, obstructs anybody's light, except in cases where a
church, a school-house, or a dwelling house would have equally
obstructed it. On this ground, therefore, the former are no more,
and no less, nuisances than the latter would be. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Some
persons are in the habit of saying that a liquorshop is
dangerous, in the same way that gunpowder is dangerous. But there
is no analogy between the two cases. Gunpowder is liable to be
exploded by accident, and especially by such fires as often occur
in cities. For these reasons it is dangerous to persons and
property in its immediate vicinity. But liquors are not liable to
be thus exploded, and therefore are not dangerous nuisances, in
any such sense as is gunpowder in cities. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> But
it is said, again, that drinking-places are frequently filled
with noisy and boisterous men, who disturb the quiet of the
neighborhood, and the sleep and rest of the neighbors. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> This
may be true occasionally, though not very frequently. But
whenever, in any case, it is true, the nuisance may be abated by
the punishment of the proprietor and his customers, and if need
be, by shutting up the place. But an assembly of noisy drinkers
is no more a nuisance than is any other noisy assembly. A jolly
or hilarious drinker disturbs the quiet of a neighborhood no
more, and no less, than does a shouting religious fanatic. An
assembly of noisy drinkers is no more, and no less, a nuisance
than is an assembly of shouting religious fanatics. Both of them
are nuisances when they disturb the rest and sleep, or quiet, or
neighbors. Even a dog that is given to barking, to the
disturbance of the sleep or quiet of the neighborhood, is a
nuisance. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> XIX.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left">  But
it is said, that for one person to entice another into a vice, is
a crime. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  This
is preposterous. If any particular act is simply a vice, then a
man who entices another to commit it, is simply an accomplice in
the vice. He evidently commits no crime, because the accomplice
can certainly commit no greater offence than the principal. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Every
person who is sane, compos mentis, possessed of reasonable
discretion and self-control, is presumed to be mentally competent
to judge for himself of all the arguments, pro and con, that may
be addressed to him, to persuade him to do any particular act;
provided no fraud is employed to deceive him. And if he is
persuaded or induced to do the act, his act is then his own; and
even though the act prove to be harmful to himself, he cannot
complain that the persuasion or arguments, to which he yielded
his assent, were crimes against himself. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> When
fraud is practised, the case is, of course, different. If, for
example, I offer a man poison, assuring him that it is a safe and
wholesome drink, and he, on the faith of my assertion, swallows
it, my act is a crime. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  Volenti
non fit injuria, is a maxim of the law. To the willing, no injury
is done. That is, no legal wrong. And every person who is sane,
compos mentis, capable of exercising reasonable discretion in
judging of the truth or falsehood of the representations or
persuasion to which he yields his assent, is &quot;willing,&quot;
in the view of the law,; and takes upon himself the entire
responsibility for his acts, when no intentional fraud has been
practised upon him. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> This
principle, that to the willing no injury is done, has no limit,
except in the case of frauds, or of persons not possessed of
reasonable discretion for judging in the particular case. If a
person possessed of reasonable discretion, and not deceived by
fraud, consents to practise the grossest vice, and thereby brings
upon himself the greatest moral, physical, or pecuniary
sufferings or losses, he cannot allege that he has been legally
wronged. To illustrate this principle, take the case of rape. To
have carnal knowledge of a woman, against her will, is the
highest crime, next to murder, that can be committed against her.
but to have carnal knowledge of her, with her consent, is no
crime; but at most, a vice. And it is usually holden that a
female child, of no more than ten years of age, has such
reasonable discretion, that her consent, even though procured by
rewards, or promises of reward, is sufficient to convert the act,
which would otherwise be a high crime, into a simple act of vice.</kbd></font><a
href="#note2"> 2</kbd></sup></font></a>  </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> We
see the same principle in the case of prize-fighters. If I but
lay one of my fingers upon another man's person, against his
will, no matter how lightly, and no matter how little practical
injury is done, the act is a crime. But if two men agree to go
out and pound each other's faces to a jelly, it is no crime, but
only a vice. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Even
duels have not generally been considered crimes, because each
man's life is his own, and the parties agree that each may take
the other's life, if he can, by the use of such weapons as are
agreed upon, and in conformity with certain rules that are also
mutually assented to. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> And
this is a correct view of the matter, unless it can be said (as
it probably cannot), that &quot;anger is madness&quot; that so
far deprives men of their reason as to make them incapable of
reasonable discretion. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Gambling
is another illustration of the principle that to the willing no
injury is done. If I take but a single cent of a man's property,
without his consent, the act is a crime. But if two men, who are
compos mentis, possessed of reasonable discretion to judge of the
nature and probable results of their act, sit down together, and
each voluntarily stakes his money against the money of another,
on the turn of a die, and one of them loses his whole estate
(however large that may be), it is no crime, but only a vice. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> It
is not a crime, even, to assist a person to commit suicide, if he
be in possession of his reason. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> It
is a somewhat common idea that suicide is, of itself, conclusive
evidence of insanity. But, although it may ordinarily be very
strong evidence of insanity, it is by no means conclusive in all
cases. Many persons, in undoubted possession of their reason,
have committed suicide, to escape the shame of a public exposure
for their crimes, or to avoid some other great calamity. Suicide,
in these cases, may not have been the highest wisdom, but it
certainly was not proof of any lack of reasonable discretion.</kbd></font><a
href="#note3"> 3</kbd></sup></font></a> And being within the
limits of reasonable discretion, it was no crime for other
persons to aid it, either by furnishing the instrument or
otherwise. And if, in such cases, it be no crime to aid a
suicide, how absurd to say that, it is a crime to aid him in some
act that is really pleasurable, and which a large portion of
mankind have believed to be useful? </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> XX.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> But
some persons are in the habit of saying that the use of
spirituous liquors is the great source of crime; that &quot;it
fills our prisons with criminals;&quot; and that this is reason
enough for prohibiting the sale of them. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  Those
who say this, if they talk seriously, talk blindly and foolishly.
They evidently mean to be understood as saying that a very large
percentage of all the crimes that are committed among men, are
committed by persons whose criminal passions are excited, at the
time, by the use of liquors, and in consequence of the use of
liquors. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> This
idea is utterly preposterous. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> In
the first place, the great crimes committed in the world are
mostly prompted by avarice and ambition. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> The
greatest of all crimes are the wars that are carried on by
governments, to plunder, enslave, and destroy mankind. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  The
next greatest crimes committed in the world are equally prompted
by avarice and ambition; and are committed, not on sudden
passion, but by men of calculation, who keep their heads cool and
clear, and who have no thought whatever of going to prison for
them. They are committed, not so much by men who violate the
laws, as by men who, either by themselves or by their
instruments, make the laws; by men who have combined to usurp
arbitrary power, and to maintain it by force and fraud, and whose
purpose in usurping and maintaining it is by unjust and unequal
legislation, to secure to themselves such advantages and
monopolies as will enable them to control and extort the labor
and properties of other men, and thus impoverish them, in order
to minister to their own wealth and aggrandizement.</kbd></font><a
href="#note4"> 4</kbd></sup></font></a> The robberies and
wrongs thus committed by these men, in conformity with the laws,
- that is, their own laws - are as mountains to molehills,
compared with the crimes committed by all other criminals, in
violation of the laws. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> But,
thirdly, there are vast numbers of frauds, of various kinds,
committed in the transactions of trade, whose perpetrators, by
their coolness and sagacity, evade the operation of the laws. And
it is only their cool and clear heads that enable them to do it.
Men under the excitement of intoxicating drinks are little
disposed, and utterly unequal, to the successful practice of
these frauds. They are the most incautious, the least successful,
the least efficient, and the least to be feared, of all the
criminals with whom the laws have to deal. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  Fourthly.
The professed burglars, robbers, thieves, forgers,
counterfeiters, and swindlers, who prey upon society, are
anything but reckless drinkers. Their business is of too
dangerous a character to admit of such risks as they would thus
incur. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Fifthly.
The crimes that can be said to be committed under the influence
of intoxicating drinks are mostly assaults and batteries, not
very numerous, and generally not very aggravated. Some other
small crimes, as petty thefts, or other small trespasses upon
property, are sometimes committed, under the influence of drink,
by feebleminded persons, not generally addicted to crime. The
persons who commit these two kinds of crime are but few. They
cannot be said to &quot;fill our prisons&quot;; or, if they do,
we are to be congratulated that we need so few prisons, and so
small prisons, to hold them. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  The
State of Massachusetts, for example, has a million and a half of
people. How many of these are now in prison for crimes - not for
the vice of intoxication, but for crimes - committed against
persons or property under the instigation of strong drink? I
doubt if there be one in ten thousand, that is, one hundred and
fifty in all; and the crimes for which these are in prison are
mostly very small ones. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  And
I think it will be found that these few men are generally much
more to be pitied than punished, for the reason that it was their
poverty and misery, rather than any passion for liquor, or for
crime, that led them to drink, and thus led them to commit their
crimes under the influence of drink. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> The
sweeping charge that drink &quot;fills our prisons with
criminals&quot; is made, I think, only by those men who know no
better than to call a drunkard a criminal; and who have no better
foundation for their charge than the shameful fact that we are
such a brutal and senseless people, that we condemn and punish
such weak and unfortunate persons as drunkards, as if they were
criminals. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> The
legislators who authorize, and the judges who practise, such
atrocities as these, are intrinsically criminals; unless their
ignorance be such - as it probably is not - as to excuse them.
And, if they were themselves to be punished as criminals, there
would be more reason in our conduct. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> A
police judge in Boston once told me that he was in the habit of
disposing of drunkards (by sending them to prison for thirty days
- I think that was the stereotyped sentence) at the rate of one
in three minutes!, and sometimes more rapidly even than that;
thus condemning them as criminals, and sending them to prison,
without mercy, and without inquiry into circumstances, for an
infirmity that entitled them to compassion and protection,
instead of punishment. The real criminals in these cases were not
the men who went to prison, but the judge, and the men behind
him, who sent them there. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> I
recommend to those persons, who are so distressed lest the
prisons of Massachusetts be filled with criminals, that they
employ some portion, at least, of their philanthropy in
preventing our prisons being filled with persons who are not
criminals. I do not remember to have heard that their sympathies
have ever been very actively exercised in that direction. On the
contrary, they seem to have such a passion for punishing
criminals, that they care not to inquire particularly whether a
candidate for punishment really be a criminal. Such a passion,
let me assure them, is a much more dangerous one, and one
entitled to far less charity, both morally and legally, than the
passion for strong drink. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> It
seems to be much more consonant with the merciless character of
these men to send an unfortunate man to prison for drunkenness,
and thus crush, and degrade, and dishearten him, and ruin him for
life, than it does for them to lift him out of the poverty and
misery that caused him to become a drunkard. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> It
is only those persons who have either little capacity, or little
disposition, to enlighten, encourage, or aid mankind, that are
possessed of this violent passion for governing, commanding, and
punishing them. If, instead of standing by, and giving their
consent and sanction to all the laws by which the weak man is
first plundered, oppressed, and disheartened, and then punished
as a criminal, they would turn their attention to the duty of
defending his rights and improving his condition, and of thus
strengthening him, and enabling him to stand on his own feet, and
withstand the temptations that surround him, they would, I think,
have little need to talk about laws and prisons for either
rum-sellers or rum-drinkers, or even any other class of ordinary
criminals. If, in short, these men, who are so anxious for the
suppression of crime, would suspend, for a while, their calls
upon the government for aid in suppressing the crimes of
individuals, and would call upon the people for aid in
suppressing the crimes of the government, they would show both
their sincerity and good sense in a much stronger light than they
do now. When the laws shall all be so just and equitable as to
make it possible for all men and women to live honestly and
virtuously, and to make themselves comfortable and happy, there
will be much fewer occasions than now for charging them with
living dishonestly and viciously. </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> XXI.</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"> But
it will be said, again, that the use of spirituous liquors tends
to poverty, and thus to make men paupers, and burdensome to the
tax-payers; and the this is a sufficient reason why the sale of
them should be prohibited. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> There
are various answers to this argument. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  1.
One answer is, that if the fact that the use of liquors tends to
poverty and pauperism, be a sufficient reason for prohibiting the
sale of them, it is equally a sufficient reason for prohibiting
the use of them; for it is the use, and not the sale, that tends
to poverty. The seller is, at most, merely an accomplice of the
drinker. And it is a rule of law, as well as of reason, that if
the principal in any act is not punishable, the accomplice cannot
be. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> 2.
A second answer to the argument is, that if government has the
right, and is bound, to prohibit any one act - that is not
criminal - merely because it is supposed to tend to poverty,
then, by the same rule, it has the right, and is bound, to
prohibit any and every other act - though not criminal - which,
in the opinion of the government, tends to poverty. And, on this
principle, the government would not only have the right, but
would be bound, to look unto every man's private affairs and
every persons personal expenditures, and determine as to which of
them did, and which of them did not, tend to poverty; and to
prohibit and punish all of the former class. A man would have no
right to expend a cent of his own property, according to his own
pleasure or judgement, unless the legislature should be of the
opinion that such expenditure would not tend to poverty. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> 3.
A third answer to the same argument is that if a man does bring
himself to poverty, and even to beggary - either by his virtues
or his vices - the government is under no obligation whatever to
take care of him, unless it pleases to do so. It may let him
perish in the street, or depend upon private charity, if it so
pleases. It can carry out its own free will and discretion in the
matter; for it is above all legal responsibility in such a case.
It is not, necessarily, any part of a government's duty to
provide for the poor. A government - that is, a legitimate
government - is simply a voluntary association of individuals,
who unite for such purposes, and only for such purposes, as suits
them. if taking care of the poor - whether they be virtuous or
vicious - be not one of those purposes, then the government, as a
government, has no more right, and is no more bound, to take care
of them, than has or is a banking company, or a railroad company.
</kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Whatever
moral claims a poor man - whether he be virtuous or vicious - may
have upon the charity of his fellow-men, he has no legal claims
upon them. He must depend wholly upon their charity, if they so
please. He cannot demand, as a legal right, that they either feed
or clothe him. and he has no more legal or moral claims upon a
government - which is but an association of individuals - than he
has upon the same, or any other individuals, in their private
capacity. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Inasmuch,
then, as a poor man - whether virtuous or vicious - has no more
or other claims, legal or moral, upon a government, for food or
clothing, than he has upon private persons, a government has no
more right than a private person to control or prohibit the
expenditures or actions of an individual, on the ground that they
tend to bring him to poverty. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Mr.
A. as an individual, has clearly no right to prohibit any acts or
expenditures of Mr. Z, through fear that such acts or
expenditures may tend to bring him (Z) to poverty, and that he
(Z) may, in consequence, at some future unknown time, come to him
(A) in distress, and ask charity. And if A has no such right, as
an individual, to prohibit any acts or expenditures on the part
of Z, then government, which is a mere association of
individuals, can have no such right. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  Certainly
no man, who is compos mentis, holds his right to the disposal and
use of his own property, by any such worthless tenure as that
which would authorize any or all of his neighbors - whether
calling themselves a government or not - to interfere, and forbid
him to make any expenditures, except such as they might think
would not tend to poverty, and would not tend to ever bring him
to them as a supplicant for their charity. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">   Whether
a man, who is compos mentis, come to poverty, through his virtues
or his vices, no man, nor body of men, can have any right to
interfere with him, on the ground that their sympathy may some
time be appealed to in his behalf; because, if it should be
appealed to, they are at perfect liberty to act their own
pleasure or discretion as to complying with his solicitations. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> This
right to refuse charity to the poor - whether the latter be
virtuous or vicious - is one that governments always act upon. No
government makes any more provision for the poor than it pleases.
As a consequence, the poor are left to suffer sickness, and even
death, because neither public nor private charity comes to their
aid. How absurd, then, to say that government has a right to
control a man's use of his own property, through fear that he may
sometime come to poverty, and ask charity. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  4.
Still a fourth answer to the argument is, that the great and only
incentive which each individual man has to labor, and to create
wealth, is that he may dispose of it according to his own
pleasure or discretion, and for the promotion of his own
happiness, and the happiness of those whom he loves.</kbd></font><a
href="#note5">  5</kbd></sup></font></a> </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  Although
a man may often, from inexperience or want of judgement, expend
some portion of the products of his labor injudiciously, and so
as not to promote his highest welfare, yet he learns wisdom in
this, as in all other matters, by experience; by his mistakes as
well as by his successes. and this is the only way in which he
can learn wisdom. When he becomes convinced that he has made one
foolish expenditure, he learns thereby not to make another like
it. And he must be permitted to try his own experiments, and to
try them to his won satisfaction, in this as in all other
matters; for otherwise he has no motive to labor, or to create
wealth at all. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Any
man, who is a man, would rather be a savage, and be free,
creating or procuring only such little wealth as he could control
and consume from day to day, than to be a civilized man, knowing
how to create and accumulate wealth indefinitely, and yet not
permitted to use or dispose of it, except under the supervision,
direction, and dictation of a set of meddlesome, superserviceable
fools and tyrants, who with no more knowledge than himself, and
perhaps with not half so much, should assume to control him, on
the ground that he had not the right, or the capacity, to
determine for himself as to what he would do with the proceeds of
his own labor. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> 5.
A fifth answer to the argument is, that if it be the duty of
government to watch over the expenditures of any one person - who
is compos mentis, and not criminal - to see what ones tend to
poverty, and what do not, and to prohibit and punish the former,
then, by the same rule, it is bound to watch over the
expenditures of all other persons, and prohibit and punish all
that, in its judgement, tend to poverty. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  If
such a principle were carried out impartially, the result would
be, that all mankind would be so occupied in watching each
other's expenditures, and in testifying against, trying, and
punishing such as tended to poverty, that they would have no time
left to create wealth at all. Everybody capable of productive
labor would either be in prison, or be acting as judge, juror,
witness, or jailer. It would be impossible to create courts
enough to try, or to build prisons enough to hold, the offenders.
All productive labor would cease; and the fools that were so
intent on preventing poverty, would not only all come to poverty,
imprisonment, and starvation themselves, but would bring
everybody else to poverty, imprisonment, and starvation. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left">  6.
If it be said that a man may, at least, be rightfully compelled
to support his family, and, consequently, to abstain from all
expenditures that, in the opinion of the government, tend to
disable him to perform that duty, various answers might be given.
But this one is sufficient, viz.: that no man, unless a fool or a
slave, would acknowledge any family to be his, if that
acknowledgment were to be made an excuse, by the government, for
depriving him, either of his personal liberty, or the control of
his property. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> When
a man is allowed his natural liberty, and the control of his
property, his family is usually, almost universally, the great
paramount object of his pride and affection; and he will, not
only voluntarily, but as his highest pleasure, employ his best
powers of mind and body, not merely to provide for them the
ordinary necessaries and comforts of life, but to lavish upon
them all the luxuries and elegancies that his labor can procure. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> A
man enters into no moral or legal obligation with his wife or
children to do anything for them, except what he can do
consistently with his own personal freedom, and his natural right
to control his own property at his own discretion. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> If
a government can step in and say to a man - who is compos mentis,
and who is doing his duty to his family, as he sees his duty, and
according to his best judgement, however imperfect that may be -
We (the government) suspect that you are not employing your labor
to the best advantage for your family; we suspect that your
expenditures, and your disposal of your property, are not so
judicious as they might be, for the interest of your family; and
therefore we (the government) will take you and your property
under our special surveillance, and prescribe to you what you
may, and may not do, with yourself and your property; and your
family shall hereafter look to us (the government), and not to
you, for support: - if a government can do this, all a man's
pride, ambition, and affection, relative to this family, would be
crushed, so far as it would be possible for human tyranny to
crush them; and he would either never have a family (whom he
would publicly acknowledge to be his), or he would risk both his
property and his life in overthrowing such an insulting,
outrageous, and insufferable tyranny. And any woman who would
wish her husband - he being compos mentis - to submit to such an
unnatural insult and wrong, is utterly undeserving of his
affection, or of anything but his disgust and contempt. And he
would probably very soon cause her to understand that, if who
chose to rely on the government, for the support of herself and
her children, rather than on him, she must rely on the government
alone. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Still
another and all-sufficient answer to the argument that the use of
spirituous liquors tends to poverty, is that, as a general rule,
it puts the effect before the cause. It assumes that it is the
use of the liquors that causes the poverty, instead of its being
the poverty that causes the use of the liquors. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Poverty
is the natural parent of nearly all the ignorance, vice, crime,
and misery there are in the world.</kbd></font><a href="#note6">  6</kbd></sup></font></a> Why is it that so
large a portion of the laboring people of England are drunken and
vicious? Certainly not because they are by nature any worse than
other men. But it is because, their extreme and hopeless poverty
keeps them in ignorance and servitude, destroys their courage and
self-respect, subjects them to such constant insults and wrongs,
to such incessant and bitter miseries of every king, and finally
drives them to such despair, that the short respite that drink or
other vice affords them, is, for the time being, a relief. This
is the chief cause of the drunkenness and other vices that
prevail among the laboring people of England. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> If
those laborers of England, who are now drunken and vicious, had
had the same chances and surroundings in life as the more
fortunate classes have had; if they had been reared in
comfortable, and happy, and virtuous homes, instead of squalid,
and wretched, and vicious ones; if they had had opportunities to
acquire knowledge and property, and make themselves intelligent,
comfortable, happy, independent, and respected, and to secure to
themselves all the intellectual, social, and domestic enjoyments
which honest and justly rewarded industry could enable them to
secure - if they could have had all this, instead of being born
to a life of hopeless, unrewarded toil, with a certainty of death
in the workhouse, they would have been as free from their present
vices and weaknesses as those who reproach them now are. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> It
is of no use to say that drunkenness, or any other vice, only
adds to their miseries; for such is human nature - the weakness
of human nature, if you please - that men can endure but a
certain amount of misery before their hope and courage fail, and
they yield to almost anything that promises present relief or
mitigation; though at the cost of still greater misery in the
future. To preach morality or temperance to such wretched
persons, instead of relieving their sufferings, or improving
their conditions, is only insulting their wretchedness. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> Will
those who are in the habit of attributing men's poverty to their
vices, instead of their vices to their poverty - as if every poor
person, or most poor persons, were specially vicious - tell us
whether all the poverty within the last year and a half</kbd></font><a
href="#note7"> 7</kbd></sup></font></a>  have been brought so
suddenly - as it were in a moment - upon at least twenty millions
of the people of the United States, were brought upon them as a
natural consequence, either of their drunkenness, or of any other
of their vices? Was it their drunkenness, or any other of their
vices, that paralyzed, as by a stroke of lightning, all the
industries by which they lived, and which had, but a few days
before, been in such prosperous activity? Was it their vices that
turned the adult portion of those twenty millions out of doors
without employment, compelled them to consume their little
accumulations, if they had any, and then to become beggars -
beggars for work, and, failing in this, beggars for bread? Was it
their vices that, all at once, and without warning, filled the
homes of so many of them with want, misery, sickness, and death?
No. Clearly it was neither the drunkenness, nor any other vices,
of these laboring people, that brought upon them all this ruin
and wretchedness. And if it was not, what was it? </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> This
is the problem that must be answered; for it is one that is
repeatedly occuring, and constantly before us, and that cannot be
put aside. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> In
fact, the poverty of the great body of mankind, the world over,
is the great problem of the world. That such extreme and nearly
universal poverty exists all over the world, and has existed
through all past generations, proves that it originates in causes
which the common human nature of those who suffer from it, has
not hitherto been strong enough to overcome. But these sufferers
are, at least, beginning to see these causes, and are becoming
resolute to remove them, let it cost what it may. And those who
imagine that they have nothing to do but to go on attributing the
poverty of the poor to their vices, and preaching to them against
their vices, will ere long wake up to find that the day for all
such talk is past. And the question will then be, not what are
men's vices, but what are their rights? </kbd></font></p>

<h3 align="left"> NOTES</kbd></font></h3>

<p align="left"><a name="note1"> 1</kbd></font></a> To give an insane
man a knife, or any other weapon, or thing, by which he is likely
to injure himself, is a crime. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"><a name="note2"> 2</kbd></font></a> The statute book of
Massachusetts makes ten years the age at which a female child is
supposed to have discretion enough to part with her virtue. But
the same statute book holds that no person, man or woman, of any
age, or any degree of wisdom or experience, has discretion enough
to be trusted to buy and drink a glass of spirits, on his or her
own judgement! What an illustration of the legislative wisdom of
Massachusetts! </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"><a name="note3"> 3</kbd></font></a> Cato committed
suicide to avoid falling into the hands of Caesar. Who ever
suspected that he was insane? Brutus did the same. Colt committed
suicide only an hour or so before he was to be hanged. He did it
to avoid bringing upon his name and his family the disgrace of
having it said that he was hanged. This, whether a really wise
act or not, was clearly an act within reasonable discretion. Does
any one suppose that the person who furnished him with the
necessary instrument was a criminal? </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> <a name="note4"> 4</kbd></font></a> An illustration of
this fact is found in England, whose government, for a thousand
years and more, has been little or nothing else than a band of
robbers, who have conspired to monopolize the land, and, as far
as possible, all other wealth. These conspirators, calling
themselves kings, nobles, and freeholders, have, by force and
fraud, taken to themselves all civil and military power; they
keep themselves in power solely by force and fraud, and the
corrupt use of their wealth; and they employ their power solely
in robbing and enslaving the great body of their own people, and
in plundering and enslaving other peoples. And the world has
been, and now is, full of examples substantially similar. And the
governments of our own country do not differ so widely from
others, in this respect, as some of us imagine. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"><a name="note5"> 5</kbd></font></a> It is to this
incentive alone that we are indebted for all the wealth that has
ever been created by human labor, and accumulated for the benefit
of mankind. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"> <a name="note6"> 6</kbd></font></a> Except those great
crimes, which the few, calling themselves governments, practise
upon the many, by means of organized, systematic extortion and
tyranny. And it is only the poverty, ignorance, and consequent
weakness of the many, that enable the combined and organized few
to acquire and maintain such arbitrary power over them. </kbd></font></p>

<p align="left"><a name="note7"> 7</kbd></font></a> That is, from
September 1, 1873, to March 1, 1875. </kbd></font></p>
