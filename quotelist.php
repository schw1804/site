Although it has been said that each generation grows wiser and wiser, yet we have no reason to think that they grow better and better. And therefore the probability lies upon the dark side.

    "From time to time, readers of ANALYSIS urge upon me the espousal of some program they are pleased to call \"constructive.\" ... <br/> Every one of the proposed reforms has something to commend it, while the sincerity of the proponents makes one wish they might succeed. The fact remains, however, that the reform invariably rests its case on the good-will, intelligence, and selflessness of men who, invested with the power to do so, will put the reform into operation. And the lesson of history is that power is never so used. Never. I am convinced, on the other hand, that all of the evils of which these honest people complain can be traced to the misuse of power, and am therefore inclined to distrust political power of any kind. ... The only \"constructive\" idea that I can in all conscience advance, then, is that the individual put his trust in himself, not in power; that he seek to better his understanding and lift his values to a higher and still higher level; that he assume responsibility for his behavior and not shift his responsibility to committees, organizations, and, above all, a superpersonal State. Such reforms as are necessary will come of themselves when, or if, men act as intelligent and responsible human beings. There cannot be a \"good\" society until there are \"good\" men. <br/> - [Reprinted from THE FREEMAN, November 1974, p. 690 and originally excerpted from ANALYSIS, July 1949, Frank Chodorov, editor.] ",

This has often been done, and was a major impetus to alchemy, and the manufacture of spurious gold and silver. But paper money invited counterfeiting by its very nature, since the essence of it is not its inherent substance but the authority on which it was issued. Paper money is a symbol. To counterfeit is therefore not to fabricate a substance but to impersonate the authority issuing it. Since anyone can print on pieces of paper, the authority must make the processes of manufacture of its paper money so intricate that they cannot be exactly reproduced.<br/> <br/> - Robert Temple, THE GENIUS OF CHINA (1986), p. 118.

    "&ldquo;Slavery the worst form of Stealing. Whatever may be said of other possessions, a man&rsquo;s person is his own; his life is his own; his liberty is his own. He who takes them away without his consent, and without any crime on his part, steals them.

The eighth commandment, then, forbids, distinctly and peremptorily, all the despotic enslaving of our fellow men, of whatever condition or color, or of exercising absolute lordship over them; because those acts virtually deprive human beings of that property in themselves with which the Creator endowed them. This is a usurpation of the rights of man which no usage, law or custom, can legalize in the sight of heaven. No title can make good my claim to another&rsquo;s person; no deed of inheritance or conveyance transmits it to a third party. ... Every man under God, owns himself; He has a right to himself which no other man can challenge. I may be lawfully restrained, punished, and even executed by just laws; but I can never be owned; I can never be in the sight of God, either serf or slave; I cannot sell myself; no other can sell me. - Though I may, for a consideration, make over to another my right to my services, yet the right to myself is no more alienable by myself than by another.&rdquo; <br/> - from George Bush, \"Notes on Exodus,\" published in Vol. 7, No. 32, HERALD OF FREEDOM (October 1, 1841), p. 1 ",

    "The power [of coining money] itself is a frivolous one, of little or no utility; for the weighing and assaying of metals is a thing so easily done, and can be done by so many different persons, that there is certainly no necessity for it being done at all by a government,. And it would undoubtedly have been far better if all coins - whether coined by governments or individuals - had all been made into pieces bearing simply the names of pounds, ounces, pennyweights, etc., and containing just the amounts of pure metal described by those weights. The coins would have then been regarded as only so much metal; and as having only the same value as the same amount of metal in any other form. Men would then have known exactly how much of certain metals they were buying, selling, and promising to pay. And all the jugglery, cheating, and robbery that governments have practised, and licensed individuals to practise - by coining pieces bearing the same names, but having different amounts of metal - would have been avoided. <br/> - Lysander Spooner, A LETTER TO GROVER CLEVLAND, Sec.XXII (1886).

    "&ldquo;The practical reason for freedom, then, is that freedom seems to be the only condition under which any kind of substantial moral fibre can be developed. Everything else has been tried [and failed]. ... In suggesting that we try freedom ... the anarchist ... has a strictly practical aim. He aims at the production of a race of responsible beings. ... His desire for freedom has but one practical object, ie, that men may become as good and as decent, as elevated and noble, as they might be and really wish to be. Reason, experience, and observation lead him to the conviction that under absolute and unqualified freedom they can and rather promptly will, educate themselves to this desirable end; but that so long as they are the least degree dominated by legalism and authoritarianism, they never can.&rdquo; <br/> - A.

    "Why Don&rsquo;t You Propose Something Constructive? From time to time, readers of ANALYSIS urge upon me the espousal of some program they are pleased to call &ldquo;constructive.&rdquo; ... Every one of the proposed reforms has something to commend it, while the sincerity of the proponents makes one wish they might succeed. The fact remains, however, that the reform invariably rests its case on the good-will, intelligence, and selflessness of men who, invested with the power to do so, will put the reform into operation. And the lesson of history is that power is never so used. Never. I am convinced, on the other hand, that all of the evils of which these honest people complain can be traced to the misuse of power, and am therefore inclined to distrust political power of any kind. ... The only &ldquo;constructive&rdquo; idea that I can in all conscience advance, then, is that the individual put his trust in himself, not in power; that he seek to better his understanding and lift his values to a higher and still higher level; that he assume responsibility for his behavior and not shift his responsibility to committees, organizations, and, above all, a superpersonal State.

                     <b>Statement of Purpose:</b> Voluntaryists are advocates of non-political, non-violent strategies to achieve
                     a free society. We reject electoral politics, in theory and in practice, as incompatible
                     with libertarian principles. Governments must cloak their actions in an aura
                     of moral legitimacy in order to sustain their power, and political methods invariably
                     strengthen that legitimacy. Voluntaryists seek instead to delegitimize the State
                     through education, and we advocate withdrawal of the cooperation and tacit consent
                     on which State power ultimately depends.</p>
